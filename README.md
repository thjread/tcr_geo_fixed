# Code for the paper "On the geometric fixed points of the real topological cyclic homology of $\mathbb{Z}/4$

Code for computations related to computing homotopy groups of $\mathrm{TCR}(\mathbb{Z}/4)^{\phi \mathbb{Z}/2}$.

The code is contained in `methods.sage`, while `Computation.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook demonstrating how to call this code to do the desired computations. The corresponding program output (including all results needed for the paper) is in `results.pdf`.
